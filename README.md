Hi! I am Diya Shah, a third-year computer science student, I have a good foundation in computer science and am currently honing my skills in web development, C++, Java and Data Analysis. 
Beyond technical skills, I possess strong abilities in writing and management. I firmly believe that effective communication and organizational skills are essential for any computer science professional, facilitating better teamwork, clearer project goals, and more efficient workflows.
My academic journey has equipped me with a robust understanding of these areas, and I am eager to apply this knowledge in practical, real-world scenarios.
I am excited to continue learning and growing in my field.Eager to connect with both seasoned professionals and fellow students to broaden knowledge and gain insights from diverse experiences. Open to collaboration and growth opportunities in the dynamic field of technology.
